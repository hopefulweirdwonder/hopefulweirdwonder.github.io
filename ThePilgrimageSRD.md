## Overview  
Games using the Pilgrimage SRD are likely to be solo, prompt based journaling games about going on a trip and managing resources while holding to a code of conduct or ethics.   
When using this system, you should define four resources, one of which is a meter (Time), the other three which reflect the character's strengths.  
## Items Required for Play  
Built on Pilgrimage games require a dice roller or dice (2d6, 1d8, 1d4), a piece of paper, a writing instrument, and appropriate background music if you like.  
## Character Creation  
Roll 2d6 and distribute that total among the 3 Resources. Then set the metered resource at 6. Then select a Character type with their corresponding drive, cherished item, and two adjective Traits. Including spark tables to give the characters additional flavor.   
## Prompts and Locations  
Prompts are structured around Locations or settings. Each location has  2d6 or 11 prompts. The original Pilgrimage game has 5 Locations.  
The format of prompts is intended to laser in on a situation, and then ask a provocative question that requires spending one or more Resources and reveals something about the character. Prompts should be related to the Location. The game requires 11 prompts per location and the prompt structure is generally:
*2-5 High Difficulty, Low Benefit
*6-9 Medium Difficulty, Medium Benefit
*10-12 Low Difficulty, High Benefit  
## Resources  
You should have 3 Resources plus a metered resource like time. Resources can be related to a character's physical strength, mental strength, social reputation or skills, or other resources as appropriate to your game. If a player runs out of resources, the character can choose to break their ethical code in some small or large way to regain d6 resources. The player rolls a on a d6 table on ethical mistakes. Prompts for this d6 table should all be explicit about how the ethical code was broken and what they learned. In a zombie game it could be something like:
"While staying at a settlement in your desperation you stole something that didn't belong to you and was important to that community. What did you steal, what impact did it have? What did you learn?"  
## The Cycle of Play  
First turn to the next Location. Spend 1 Time.  
Then, roll 2d6 and add the dice. This is your first prompt. Read the prompt and follow the directions. 
At each location you will roll for two prompts unless otherwise directed. Reroll your dice if you get the same prompt.
Prompts are based around choices your character would make on their journey. You will spend or gain resources, and earn Reputation. Record these on your sheet.
